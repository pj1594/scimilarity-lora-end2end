## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Experimental Summary

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Base Model** | SCimilarity v1.1 (Genentech 2023) |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Error Analysis

### üîπ Top-5 Misclassified Cell Populations
| True Label | Predicted | Likely Cause |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Astrocyte | Oligodendrocyte | Shared glial expression patterns |
| Endothelial Cell | Pericyte | Overlapping vascular signatures |
| CD8 T-Cell | NK Cell | Partial activation marker overlap |
| OPC | Mature Oligodendrocyte | Developmental continuum ambiguity |
| Microglia | Monocyte | Myeloid lineage proximity |

**Observation:** Misclassifications mainly occurred between biologically similar or lineage-adjacent cell types ‚Äî not random noise, indicating biologically meaningful embeddings.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation

**Challenge:**  
Fine-tuning large biological encoders can distort previously learned cell-state representations, leading to catastrophic forgetting of general cell-type relationships.

**Mitigation Strategies Used:**
1. **LoRA adapters (r = 8):** Freeze original encoder weights; train only low-rank projections ‚Üí retain general representations.
2. **Small learning rate (2e-4):** Prevents weight drift from pretrained manifold.
3. **Regularized classification head (Dropout = 0.25):** Reduces overfitting to dataset-specific noise.
4. **Validation against baseline embeddings:** Ensures embedding space structure is preserved (visualized via UMAP).

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Qualitative Visualization

**UMAP Projections:**
- *Before LoRA Fine-Tuning*: mixed clusters, weak separation.
- *After LoRA Fine-Tuning*: distinct immune/glial clusters, indicating preserved and refined embeddings.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion

- LoRA achieved comparable or superior accuracy to full fine-tuning at ~15 % compute cost.  
- Biological interpretability remained intact ‚Äî no collapse of lineage structure.  
- Demonstrates the feasibility of **parameter-efficient specialization** of foundation models for biomedical domains.  
- Future work: integrate differential expression loss to explicitly constrain drift, and explore adapters across multi-omic modalities.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

The LoRA-based adaptation of SCimilarity provides a **scalable and safe fine-tuning framework** for domain transfer in single-cell modeling.  
It preserves generalization while allowing specialization ‚Äî mitigating catastrophic forgetting, improving accuracy, and reducing compute cost ‚Äî directly aligning with **Sanofi‚Äôs AI-for-Science strategy**.
