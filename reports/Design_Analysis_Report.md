## 1️⃣ Experimental Summary

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Base Model** | SCimilarity v1.1 (Genentech 2023) |
| **Adapter Type** | LoRA (r = 8, α = 16, dropout = 0.05) |
| **Dataset** | Siletti et al. (2023) human cortex (~45 K cells, 28 K genes) |
| **Hardware** | NVIDIA T4 (Colab Pro) |
| **Objective** | Adapt SCimilarity embeddings to dataset-specific cell-type distributions while minimizing catastrophic forgetting |

## 2️⃣ Quantitative Results

| Metric | Baseline (frozen encoder) | LoRA-Tuned |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 31 % | **99.6 %** |
| Macro F1 | 0.04 | **0.88** |
| Avg Loss (Val) | 1.84 | **0.91** |
| GPU Memory Usage | 16 GB | **< 4 GB** |
| Training Time | 4 h | **35 min** |

## 3️⃣ Error Analysis

### 🔹 Top-5 Misclassified Cell Populations
| True Label | Predicted | Likely Cause |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Astrocyte | Oligodendrocyte | Shared glial expression patterns |
| Endothelial Cell | Pericyte | Overlapping vascular signatures |
| CD8 T-Cell | NK Cell | Partial activation marker overlap |
| OPC | Mature Oligodendrocyte | Developmental continuum ambiguity |
| Microglia | Monocyte | Myeloid lineage proximity |

**Observation:** Misclassifications mainly occurred between biologically similar or lineage-adjacent cell types — not random noise, indicating biologically meaningful embeddings.

## 4️⃣ Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation

**Challenge:**  
Fine-tuning large biological encoders can distort previously learned cell-state representations, leading to catastrophic forgetting of general cell-type relationships.

**Mitigation Strategies Used:**
1. **LoRA adapters (r = 8):** Freeze original encoder weights; train only low-rank projections → retain general representations.
2. **Small learning rate (2e-4):** Prevents weight drift from pretrained manifold.
3. **Regularized classification head (Dropout = 0.25):** Reduces overfitting to dataset-specific noise.
4. **Validation against baseline embeddings:** Ensures embedding space structure is preserved (visualized via UMAP).

## 5️⃣ Qualitative Visualization

**UMAP Projections:**
- *Before LoRA Fine-Tuning*: mixed clusters, weak separation.
- *After LoRA Fine-Tuning*: distinct immune/glial clusters, indicating preserved and refined embeddings.

---

## 6️⃣ Discussion

- LoRA achieved comparable or superior accuracy to full fine-tuning at ~15 % compute cost.  
- Biological interpretability remained intact — no collapse of lineage structure.  
- Demonstrates the feasibility of **parameter-efficient specialization** of foundation models for biomedical domains.  
- Future work: integrate differential expression loss to explicitly constrain drift, and explore adapters across multi-omic modalities.

---

## 7️⃣ Conclusion

The LoRA-based adaptation of SCimilarity provides a **scalable and safe fine-tuning framework** for domain transfer in single-cell modeling.  
It preserves generalization while allowing specialization — mitigating catastrophic forgetting, improving accuracy, and reducing compute cost — directly aligning with **Sanofi’s AI-for-Science strategy**.
