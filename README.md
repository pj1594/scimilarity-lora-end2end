## 🚀 Overview

This project enhances the **SCimilarity** single-cell embedding model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** with **Triplet** and **Reconstruction** losses to improve biological class separability and mitigate *catastrophic forgetting*.  
The pipeline includes:
- Comparative analysis between **baseline encoder** and **LoRA-adapted encoder**
- Automated metric computation (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, number of classes predicted)
- Triplet loss and reconstruction loss evaluations
- Error analysis (confusion matrices + top misclassified cell populations)
- **FastAPI** service for real-time cell-type inference

---

## 🧭 Methodology

### 1. Dataset & Model Setup
- Input: single-cell RNA expression vectors (28,231 genes)
- Base Model: `CellEmbedding` from SCimilarity v1.1
- LoRA Fine-Tuning:
  - Rank `r=8`, α=16
  - Learning rate `1e-4`
  - 5 epochs (Adam optimizer)
  - Combined loss: `CrossEntropy + TripletLoss + λ * ReconLoss`

### 2. Encoder Sanity Check
To ensure a **fair baseline vs LoRA** comparison:
- `encoder_base` is cloned from LoRA encoder with adapters disabled  
- Both encoders verified for identical embedding dimensions  
- Cosine similarity checks confirm distinct representation subspaces

**Sanity Check Outputs**
```
LoRA embedding shape:     (N, 128)
Baseline embedding shape: (N, 128)
warnings:
 - "Embeddings checked to be different before applying for training."
 - "Ensure head_base retrained on baseline embeddings."
```

## 📊 Updated Evaluation Results

| Model                         | Top-1 Acc | Top-3 Acc | Macro-F1  | Triplet ↓     | Recon MSE ↓     | #Classes Correct ≥1 |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| **Baseline Encoder + Linear** | 48.5%     | 88.2%     | 0.31      | 0.5         | 0.037             | 7/11                |
| **LoRA + CE only (Best)**     | **94.7%** | **98.3%** | **0.95**  | 0.221         | 0.031           | **10/11**           |
| **LoRA + Triplet + Recon**    | 88–92%    | 96–98%    | 0.90–0.93 | **0.18–0.21** | **0.028–0.031** | 8/11             |


### Interpretation
- **% accuracy improvement** → Stronger separability via Triplet loss  
- **Lower reconstruction loss** → reduced signal distortion  
- **Lower triplet loss** → tighter intra-class clusters  
- **LORA substantially improves class structure separation vs baseline** → 10/11 classes consistently predicted with ≥1 correct hit; one rare class remains challenging due to low support

LoRA + CE produces the best accuracy, because CE-only optimization sharpens supervised decision boundaries without pulling embeddings too aggressively.
Triplet + Recon reduces embedding drift and is biologically favorable; however, CE-only training gives the best raw classification.
The fact that Triplet-Loss improves cluster separation yet slightly reduces accuracy is normal — Triplet optimizes structure, not decision boundaries. This is known and published in cell-type modeling literature.

vascular associated smooth muscle cell |0.00   | 0.00   | 0.00

## Error Analysis
The only class missing consistent correct predictions (“vascular associated smooth muscle cell”) contains very few samples.
Misassignments occur toward neighbor cell-types, e.g.,
Fibroblast → Endothelial
CNS macrophage → Oligodendrocyte precursor
These mis-calls are biologically coherent, indicating that LoRA does not produce random confusions but respects ontology-level boundaries.

## 📈 Metric Interpretation

| Metric | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Top-1 Accuracy** | % of samples where the most-likely predicted class matches the true label | Measures raw classification correctness; directly reflects model reliability
| **Top-3 Accuracy** | % of samples whose true class appears in the top-3 predicted classes | Captures biological ambiguity; shows model utility even when multiple cell states overlap
| **#Classes Correct** | Count of unique cell types for which the model makes at least one correct prediction | Demonstrates model generalization and coverage across cell diversity
| **Macro-F1** | Harmonic mean of precision & recall averaged equally across classes | Balances performance across rare and abundant types; punishes over-dominance of major classes
| **Confusion Matrix** | Per-class assignment counts (true vs predicted) | Helps visualize misclassification structure and potential biological similarity between classes
| **Triplet Loss** | Enforces that embeddings of same class are closer than different classes | Measures embedding discriminability; lower is better → stronger class separation in latent space
| **Reconstruction Loss** | Measures ability to reconstruct expression from embedding | Acts as proxy for biological faithfulness; lower loss means embedding preserves transcriptomic structure
| **Per-Class Accuracy** | Correct predictions within each cell type | Shows if the model performs uniformly, not only on abundant classes
